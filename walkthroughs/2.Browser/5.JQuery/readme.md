### JQuery Introduction

This folder is a dedicated walkthrough to the JQuery library and most of it's methods and functions it provides. After the end of this module the learners should be able to understand and appreciate the easiness JQuery library provides for multiple tasks that before with vanillaJS would be a lot more difficult like: Selecting elements from DOM, changing html content and attributes on the fly, creating and appending elements to the DOM, removing elements from the DOM, making external API requests with many different functions in order to fetch data and many more. Full module's objectives can be found inside the walkthrough's link below.

Beware of the code next to each file's name. This code corresponds to an exercise lecture in goconqr
