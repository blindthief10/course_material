### Touching DOM Vanilla JS

This folder is a dedicated walkthrough to all Web API's, that are provided to us by modern browsers, in order to be able to touch the DOM and apply JavaScript to make our web pages interactive. Some of participants' key goals are to feel comfortable changing HTML, and CSS through JavaScript on the fly. Apply alterations to HTML existing structure and give a more interactive experience to our applications. Full participants' goals can be found inside the module's link below.

Beware of the code next to each file's name. This code corresponds to an exercise lecture in goconqr
