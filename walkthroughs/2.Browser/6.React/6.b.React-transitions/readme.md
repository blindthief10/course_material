### React-Transitions

This folder is a dedicated walkthrough on how to perform transitions and animations with react and the react-transition library. Key goals for participants through this topic have to do with how we can use the two main components from the react-transition library in order to perform animations either to a group of elements or to solo elements. For full objectives of this topic please refer to the link below.

Beware of the code next to each file's name. This code corresponds to an exercise lecture in goconqr
platform, inside the following link module below.

#### Trainer's path to this module:

1. The trainer shows how to install and import the main components from react-transition library.
2. What is the purpose of the TransitionGroup component? Where should be placed? The component keyword for the replaced element.
3. What is the purpose of the CSSTransition component? What is the classNames attribute? How it is connected with CSS classes that actually handle the animation or the transition? What is the timeout attribute and how it is different than transition/animation duration?
4. Applying transition/animation through css, creating the necessary classes with the corresponding names (enter, enter-active, exit, exit-active etc).
