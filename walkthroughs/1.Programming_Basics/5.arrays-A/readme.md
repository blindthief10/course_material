### JavaScript Arrays

This folder is a dedicated walkthrough devoted to the concept of JavaScript arrays. Some of the key
concepts that are covered in this module are: creating arrays to store multiple values, difference from
objects, how to iterate through an array, array methods and more. Full module's objectives can be found inside the walkthrough's link below.

Beware of the code next to each file's name. This code corresponds to an exercise lecture in goconqr
platform, inside the following link module below.

3. **A-1** more_interesting.js: **Prerequisites**: Constructing arrays, arrays length, function module, conditional statements module.
4. What is index? How to access specific slice of info, store in an array?
5. **A-2** candidate_trainer.js: **Prerequisites**: A-1 Prerequisites
