### JavaScript Arrays

This folder is a dedicated walkthrough devoted to the concept of JavaScript arrays. Some of the key
concepts that are covered in this module are: creating arrays to store multiple values, difference from
objects, how to iterate through an array, array methods and more. Full module's objectives can be found inside the walkthrough's link below.

Beware of the code next to each file's name. This code corresponds to an exercise lecture in goconqr
platform, inside the following link module below.

### JavaScript Working with Arrays

An introduction to arrays and how to store multiple values in one place [Find it here](https://www.goconqr.com/en/c/61130/course_modules/91401)

#### The trainer's path to this module:

1. Introduction to arrays. How do they differ from objects? Why is more preferable when storing relevant info?
2. How to find out how long an array is? What is the length property? How it can be used?
* **A-1** more_interesting.js: **_Prerequisites_**:
  * >Constructing arrays
  * >arrays length
  * >functions-F module
  * >conditional_decisions-D module.
3. What is index? How to access specific slice of info, store in an array?
* **A-2** candidate_trainer.js: **_Prerequisites_**:
  * >A-1 Prerequisites
4. How can we iterate through an array? How can we apply functionality for every element? For...of loop explained
* **A-3** calculate_failure.js: **_Prerequisites_**:
  * >A-1 Prerequisites
  * >looping through arrays
  * >loops-L module
5. The trainer shows the basic array methods, so they can store, retrieve, remove or update info inside an array.
* **A-4** course_evaluation_class.js: **_Prerequisites_**:
  * >A-3 Prerequisites
  * >objects-O module
  * >the **push** method
* **A-5** hire_or_not.js: **_Prerequisites_**:
  * >A-4 Prerequisites
  * >the **includes** method.
* **A-6** assemble_calculate_avg_max.js: **_Prerequisites_**:
  * >A-4 Prerequisites
  * >the **concat** method.
6. The trainer revisits and explains thoroughly the importance of filter, forEach and map functions. What is their purpose, how they can be used and what is the difference. Practical examples needed.
* **A-7** cheap_airlines.js: **_Prerequisites_**:
  * >A-4 Prerequisites
  * >Explicitly the filter, map or forEach functions  
7. The trainer shows that an array's element can also be another array. Nested arrays concept introduced.
* **A-8** groceries.js: **_Prerequisites_**:
  * >A-4 Prerequisites
  * >nested arrays concept
8. The trainer explains the reduce function and why it is used. What are the intermediate steps that the function does under the hood and how does it work? Summary of number example is needed.
* **A-9** assemble_string.js **__Prerequisites__**:
  * >A-1 Prerequisites
  * >The reduce function
  * >Basic string concatenation
* **A-10** salesToBasket.js: **_Prerequisites_**:
  * >A-3 Prerequisites
  * >hasOwnProperty
  * >objects-O module.
  * >**Optionally** the reduce function.
