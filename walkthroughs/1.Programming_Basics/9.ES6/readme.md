### EcmaScript 6 Most important topics

This folder is a dedicated walkthrough to the most important ES6 features we can make use of, in order
to make our life as developer easier. At the end of this module the participants should feel more comfortable
to achieve more by writing less and more concise code by using, default values in functions' arguments,
make use of the arrow function syntax, learn more about the find array method and what the new SET data
structure is all about. Full module's objectives can be found inside the walkthrough's link below.

Beware of the code next to each file's name. This code corresponds to an exercise lecture in goconqr
platform, inside the following link module below.

#### The trainer's path to this module:

1. The trainer explains a bit of history and the maturity that JavaScript had to come through in order to become a language that can be used in much more occasions outside the browser.
2. The trainer introduces the default values in function arguments section.
* **ES6-1** factorial.js: **_Prerequisites_**:
  * >Default values in function arguments
  * >The functions-F module
  * >The loops-L module
3. The trainer explains the concept and syntax of arrow functions, and why it is important to write less error-prone code whenever possible.
* **ES6-2** square_root.js: **_Prerequisites_**:
  * >ES-1 Prerequisites
  * >Arrow functions syntax
  * >The math-M module
* **ES6-3** check_multiples.js: **_Prerequisites_**:
  * >ES-2 Prerequisites
  * >The conditional_decisions module
4. The trainer shows the find method and how it is used in order to find the first match element inside an array. What values does it return and when?
* **ES6-4** telephone_country.js: **_Prerequisites_**:
  * >ES-3 Prerequisites
  * >The find method
  * >The arrays-A module
5. The trainer shows the **Set** data structure and explains what is the difference between a set and an array. How we can create a set, and key set methods like: add, delete, has and size
* **ES6-5** unique_names.js: **_Prerequisites_**:
  * >The set constructor and methods
  * >The arrays-A module
