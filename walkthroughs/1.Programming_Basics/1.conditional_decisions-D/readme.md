#### The trainer's path to this module:

1. Trainer introduces the concept of executing partial code depending on other values as theory.
2. The trainer introduces the if...else statement and conditional blocks.
3. What are boolean values? How can we use them in conjunction with conditional statements?
4. The trainer shows comparison operators. How can we make comparisons? What data type return?
5. The trainer introduces nested if statements. Checking and making decisions after a result is known.
6. The trainer introduces logical operators, and how to use them to check multiple conditions together
7. **D-1** FizzBuzz_only_if.js: **Prerequisites**: If...else if... else, the AND logical operator, the modulo operator, comparison equal operators, boolean values.
8. The trainer introduces the switch... case syntax and when it is preferable.
9. **D-2** ice_cream.js: **Prerequisites**: Switch_case... break and default case.
10. **D-3** lottery_numbers.js: **Prerequisites**: D-1 and D-2 prerequisites combined.
