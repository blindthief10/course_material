#### The trainer's path to this module:

* Trainer introduces the concept of executing partial code depending on other values as theory.
* The trainer introduces the if...else statement and conditional blocks.
* What are boolean values? How can we use them in conjunction with conditional statements?
* The trainer shows comparison operators. How can we make comparisons? What data type return?
* The trainer introduces nested if statements. Checking and making decisions after a result is known.
* The trainer introduces logical operators, and how to use them to check multiple conditions together
