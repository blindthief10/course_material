### Programming Basics

Above you can find all the topics that are included and must be taught during
the **Programming Basics** phase.

The order of precedence must be kept exactly as the numbers in front of the folders
indicate, as this walkthrough was built **progressively**. That means by adding
figments of knowledge into an already existing one.

Analytically the sub-topics, of which the Programming Basics module is comprised:

1. JavaScript Introduction and Basics. **The Walkthrough for this path is found below.**
2. Making Decision with JavaScript
3. JavaScript Loops and Repetitive Tasks
4. JavaScript Functions
5. JavaScript Objects
6. JavaScript Arrays
7. JavaScript Strings
8. Math and JavaScript Numbers
9. JavaScript Dates
10. ES6 Features

the purpose each module should fulfill.


### Introduction to JS

The first step into JavaScript basics [Find the walkthrough here](https://www.goconqr.com/en-US/c/59774/course_modules/89327)

As you probably noticed there is no JS introduction folder, that's because there
aren't many exercises that require storing code. Most of this first walkthrough
contains the initial steps into the world of JavaScript.

#### The trainer's path to this module:

In this case the trainer goes through:

* A generic overview of what is JavaScript. Where it can be used outside
the web landscape. What is the role of the language inside the web development industry. Of
which parts is comprised?
* The trainer prepares the class, regarding all the sub-modules and capabilities of JS in use.
**Logic part, data structures, algorithms AND DOM manipulation for adding interactivity**. A clear
separation between the logic part and the presentation part (the DOM) should be helpful for the
participants in order to understand that the latter concept uses all the cases of the first.
* The trainer shows the different ways of **injecting** JavaScript code into HTML.
* The trainer introduces the **console** and explains clearly that this is going to be their friend
for the next couple of months.
* Before executing code the trainer introduces the concept of **comments** for documenting code.
* Performing arithmetic operations with numbers. **Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and the modulo operator are introduced.**
* Introduce the concept of **data types**. Different data types, produce different result. Starting with numbers and strings, show the difference with the + operator. Adding and concatenating difference explanation.
* Storing values into **variables** in order to be used later.
