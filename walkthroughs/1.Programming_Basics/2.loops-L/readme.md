### JavaScript Loops and Repetitive Tasks

This folder is the dedicated walkthrough regarding JavaScript Loops and executing
repetitive code in JS. Some of the topics involve different types of loops, methods for
exiting the loops, skipping loops and more. Full module's objectives can be found inside the walkthrough's link below.

Beware of the code next to each file's name. This code corresponds to an exercise lecture in goconqr
platform, inside the following link module below.

#### The trainer's path to this module:

1. Trainer introduces the need of executing code repeatedly and how hard would be otherwise.
2. The trainer introduces real world problems that can be executed easily by defining repetitive tasks
3. The trainer shows the individual parts a loop is comprised of. What are all the intermediate steps?
4. The trainer introduces the while loop. How it is used? Which problem does it solve?
* **L-1** multiples_of_10s.js: **_Prereqisites_**:
  * >While loop basic functionality.
* **L-2** odd_or_even.js: **_Prereqisites_**:
  * >While loop
  * >conditional_decisions-D module.
* **L-3** fizzbuzz_loop.js: **_Prereqisites_**:
  * >All L-1 Prerequisites
* **L-4** container_initial.js: **_Prereqisites_**:
  * >All L-1 Prerequisites
5. The trainer introduces the **break** keyword inside a while loop. Use an exercise to add this progressively.
* **L-5** container_break.js: **_Prereqisites_**:
  * >All L-4 Prerequisites
  * >the break keyword.
6. The trainer introduces the **continue** keyword. Use an existing exercise to add this concept progressively
* **L-6** container_continue.js: **_Prereqisites_**:
  * >All L-5 Prerequisites
  * >the continue keyword.
7. The trainer shows the alternative option of a for loop. Modify an existing exercise with this new concept.
* **L-7** container_for.js: **_Prereqisites_**:
  * >All L-6 Prerequisites
  * >for loop.
* **L-8** employees.js: **_Prereqisites_**:
  * >For loop
  * >conditional_decisions-D module.
* **L-9** selling_clothes.js: **_Prereqisites_**:
  * >All L-8 Prerequisites
8. The trainer introduces the concept of nested loops, by showing the prime numbers from 1 to 100 problem.
* **L-10** matrix_multiplication.js: **_Prereqisites_**:
  * > Nested for loops
* **L-11** prime_numbers_refactor.js: **_Prereqisites_**:
  * >Nested loops
  * >conditional_decisions-D module.
