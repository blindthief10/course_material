#### The trainer's path to this module:

1. Trainer introduces the need of executing code repeatedly and how hard would be otherwise.
2. The trainer introduces real world problems that can be executed easily by defining repetitive tasks
3. The trainer shows the individual parts a loop is comprised of. What are all the intermediate steps?
4. The trainer introduces the while loop. How it is used? Which problem does it solve?
5. L-1 exercise
6. L-2 exercise
7. L-3 exercise
8. L-4 exercise
9. The trainer introduces the **break** keyword inside a while loop. Use an exercise to add this progressively.
10. L-5 exercise
11. The trainer introduces the **continue** keyword. Use an existing exercise to add this concept progressively
12. L-6 exercise
13. The trainer shows the alternative option of a for loop. Modify an existing exercise with this new concept.
14. L-7 exercise
15. L-8 exercise
16. L-9 exercise
17. The trainer introduces the concept of nested loops, by showing the prime numbers from 1 to 100 problem.
18. L-10 exercise
19. L-11 exercise
