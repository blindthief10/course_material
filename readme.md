# Full Year Course Material

This is the first incomplete repository regarding the course material. Here is gathered
together Theory and walkthroughs which I have included and you can navigate through the
links you will find inside each lesson folder in the **walkthroughs** folder. In the exercises folder you can find the solutions to all exercises you will find in these links. **Enjoy**

### General Structure

Every exercise inside the repository has a code in front of it. For example inside the loops section
the first exercise before title's exercise is the L-01. This is the same code you will find in tutorials
section so you can identify the exercise and the solution.

This repository is still a work in progress. **It's getting updated everyday** , so more is coming!
